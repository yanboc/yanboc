# 👋 Hi! I'm Chen Yanbo (陈彦伯)

> Last updated: Dec 18, 2025.

A Ph.D. student at Wuhan University supervised by Prof. [Weiwei Liu](https://sites.google.com/site/weiweiliuhomepage/), majoring in machine learning theory.
Prior to that, I obtained a Bachelor of Science degree from Wuhan University in 2020, majoring in mathematics. 

## 🌟 Research & Projects

**My research experience includes**

+ 2020 - 2023: Trustworthy Machine Learning. Relevant research issues include *adversarial robustness* and *black-box attacks*.

+ 2023 - Present: Feature Learning Theory. Developing theoretical frameworks for understanding how neural networks (of different structures) extract useful features (w.r.t. different tasks) from data (of varying distributions). **I am currently writing a review paper on feature learning theory, and my thesis will also revolve around this topic.**

+ 2024 - Present: LLM Alignment. Focusing on investigating the defense and attack mechanisms of adversarial attacks (jailbreaking), backdoor attacks & data poisoning (harmful fine-tuning) during the post-training and inference phases. I am also interested in inference acceleration and distributed AI systems.

**I am also serving as**

+ Reviewers for major AI conferences (e.g., NeurIPS, ICML, ICLR).
+ Contributor of the [MindNLP](https://github.com/mindspore-lab/mindnlp) and [AI Infra](https://github.com/yanboc/AIInfra).
+ A Huawei Ascend (Mindspore/Torch-NPU) developer.

**My Projects**

1. A LaTeX CV template in mandarin chinese. [一个 LaTeX 中文简历模板](https://github.com/yanboc/LaTeX-CV-template-for-Wuhan-University). (Under maintenance)
2. [Qwen CLI UI](https://github.comdddd/yanboc/Qwen-CLI-UI): a UI for *Qwen CLI* (which is kind of like Gemini CLI and Claude Code). (Last update: Jul 25'. Maintenance is planned, but not now.)
3. [Auto Literature Review](https://github.com/yanboc/auto-literature-review): an AI-powered tools for auto literature review. (Developing)

## 📝 Publications
1. A Theory of Transfer-Based Black-Box Attacks, *Y. Chen and W. Liu*, **NeurIPS 2023** ([Link](https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2023/file/2d0842550e6d92b0e27e7e810b1a4792-Paper-Conference.pdf))
