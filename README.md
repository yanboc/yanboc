# 👋 Hi! I'm Chen Yanbo (陈彦伯)

> Chen (陈) is my family name. 

A Ph.D. student at Wuhan University supervised by Prof. [Weiwei Liu](https://sites.google.com/site/weiweiliuhomepage/), majoring in machine learning theory.
Prior to that, I obtained a Bachelor of Science degree from Wuhan University in 2020, majoring in mathematics. 

## 🌟 Research & Projects

**My research experience includes**

+ 2020-2022: Trustworthy Machine Learning (Adversarial Robustness, Black-box Attacks)

+ 2023-Present: Feature Learning Theory: developing theoretical frameworks for understanding *how neural networks (of different structures) extract useful features (w.r.t. different tasks) from data (of varying distributions)*.

**I am also serving as**

+ Reviewers for NeurIPS, ICML, ICLR.
+ Contributor of the [MindNLP](https://github.com/mindspore-lab/mindnlp) project.
+ A Huawei Ascend (Mindspore/Torch-NPU) developer.
